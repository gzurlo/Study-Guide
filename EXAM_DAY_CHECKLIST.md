## ⚠️ COMMON EXAM TRAPS - DON'T FORGET!

### **Physics:**
- Work = 0 if NO displacement (even with force!)
- Inverse square law: 2× distance = 1/4 force
- Momentum is conserved in ALL collisions
- Power = Work/Time (rate of doing work)

### **Earth Science:**
- Seasons caused by TILT, not distance from Sun
- Weather = day-to-day; Climate = 30+ years
- Lifting mechanisms: 4 types (oro, frontal, convergence, convective)
- Hurricane eye is CALM (sinking air)

### **Astronomy:**
- Light-year = DISTANCE (not time!)
- Solar eclipse: Moon blocks Sun (new moon phase)
- Lunar eclipse: Earth blocks Sun (full moon phase)
- Redshift = moving AWAY
- Stars: blue = hot, red = cool
- H-R Diagram: luminosity vs temperature

## 📝 QUICK FORMULAS TO MEMORIZE

### Physics:
- F = ma
- p = mv (momentum)
- Impulse = FΔt = Δ(mv)
- Work = Fd
- Power = W/t
- KE = ½mv²
- PE = mgh
- F_gravity ∝ m₁m₂/r²

### Astronomy:
- Hubble's Law: v = H₀d
- Inverse square: I ∝ 1/r²
- Kepler's 3rd: P² ∝ a³
